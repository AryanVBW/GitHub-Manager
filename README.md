# GitHub Manager ü§ñ

A production-grade, AI-powered GitHub assistant that automatically manages issues and pull requests across **all your public repositories**. Built with Python and designed to run continuously on Heroku/AWS or any VPS.

## ‚ú® What Makes This Special

### üé≠ Replies as YOU, Not as a Bot
Unlike traditional GitHub bots that create a separate bot account, this manager **replies as the authenticated user** (you). Your responses appear natural and personal, without any "I'm a bot" signatures.

### üß† Personalized Responses for Each User
The bot analyzes each user's writing style and generates **unique, tailored responses** based on:
- **Tone**: Formal vs casual communication style
- **Length**: Brief vs detailed response preferences
- **Emoji Usage**: Matches user's emoji patterns
- **Technical Level**: Adapts to user's expertise

### üåê Multi-Repository Management
Automatically discovers and manages **ALL your public repositories** - no need to configure each one individually. One deployment, unlimited repositories.

### üé® Customizable Personality
Define your bot's personality with a custom system prompt. Be formal, casual, technical, friendly, or anything in between.

## üåü Core Features

### Intelligent Issue Assignment
- **Engagement-Based Assignment**: When multiple users request to work on an issue, assigns based on:
  - User engagement (number of comments on the issue)
  - First-come-first-served (when engagement is equal)
- **Professional Communication**: Sends confirmation to the assigned user and polite decline messages to others
- **Smart Detection**: Recognizes various assignment request phrases like "assign me", "I want to work on this", etc.

### AI-Powered Personalized Responses
- **User Style Analysis**: Analyzes each user's comment history to understand their communication style
- **Personalized Replies**: Generates responses that match each user's tone, length, and formality
- **Context-Aware**: Considers issue/PR details, labels, description, and conversation history
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Supports both Google Gemini (free) and OpenAI GPT
- **Model Selection**: Choose from multiple models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini Pro, etc.)

### Multi-Repository Support
- **Automatic Discovery**: Finds and manages all your public repositories automatically
- **No Configuration Needed**: No need to specify repository names

## üéØ How It Works

### For Issue Assignment

1. **User Comments**: Multiple users comment on an issue requesting assignment
   ```
   "Can I work on this?"
   "Assign me please"
   "I want to work on this issue"
   ```

2. **Bot Analyzes**: The bot analyzes:
   - How many times each user has commented on the issue
   - Who requested assignment first

3. **Bot Assigns**: The bot assigns the issue to the most engaged user

4. **Bot Responds** (as you, not as a bot):
   - Sends a confirmation message to the assigned user
   - Sends polite decline messages to other users

### For Personalized AI Responses

1. **User Comments**: A user asks a question or makes a comment on an issue or PR

2. **Bot Analyzes User Style**:
   - Fetches user's recent comment history (last 10 comments)
   - Analyzes writing style:
     - Average comment length
     - Tone (casual, formal, technical)
     - Formality level
     - Emoji usage patterns
     - Sentence structure

3. **Bot Generates Personalized Response**:
   - Uses AI (Gemini or OpenAI) with custom system prompt
   - Tailors response to match user's communication style
   - Considers full context:
     - Issue/PR title and description
     - Labels and current state
     - Previous conversation context
     - User's writing preferences

4. **Bot Responds** (as you, not as a bot):
   - Posts response that matches user's style
   - Each user gets a unique, personalized response
   - No "I'm a bot" signatures or identifiers

### Multi-Repository Management

1. **Automatic Discovery**: On startup, the bot:
   - Authenticates with your GitHub token
   - Discovers all your public repositories
   - Caches repository information

2. **Webhook Handling**: When a webhook is received:
   - Extracts repository information from payload
   - Retrieves the specific repository
   - Processes the event (issue comment, PR, etc.)

3. **Works Everywhere**:
   - No need to configure individual repositories
   - Add webhooks to any repository you want managed
   - Bot automatically handles events from all repositories

## üí¨ Interacting with the Bot

### Requesting Issue Assignment

Use any of these phrases in a comment:
- "assign me"
- "I want to work on this"
- "Can I work on this?"
- "I would like to work on this"
- "Please assign me"
- "I can work on this"
- "Let me work on this"

### Asking Questions
